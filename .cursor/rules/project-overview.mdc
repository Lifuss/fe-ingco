# INGCO Frontend Project Overview

This is a Next.js 14 e-commerce application for INGCO tools (B2B and B2C) built with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, React Hook Form, and Tailwind CSS.

## Routing Structure

- **Root (`/`)**: Retail catalog (B2C) - main product listing
- **Product pages (`/[productSlug]`)**: Individual product details
- **Cart (`/cart`)**: Shopping cart for retail customers
- **Favorites (`/favorites`)**: Favorite products list
- **History (`/history`)**: Order history for retail customers
- **Shop (`/shop`)**: B2B partner catalog and dashboard
- **Home (`/home`)**: Public marketing pages
- **Auth (`/auth/*`)**: Authentication pages
- **Dashboard (`/dashboard/*`)**: Admin dashboard

## Path Aliases

- `@/*` - Maps to project root (e.g., `@/lib/...`, `@/public/...`)
- `~/*` - Maps to `app/` directory (e.g., `~/ui/...`, `~/shop/...`)

## Important Project Notes

- **Language**: UI text is in Ukrainian
- **Currency**: UAH (Ukrainian Hryvnia)
- **Currency Rates**: Fetched from Monobank/PrivatBank APIs, cached for 30 minutes
- **Shipping**: Nova Poshta integration available
- **User Roles**: B2B (partners) and B2C (clients)
- **Image Domains**: Configured in `next.config.js` (localhost, be-ingco.store, api-ingco-service.win)
- **Image Formats**: WebP and AVIF preferred
- **Persistence**: Redux state persisted for currency rates, shop view, auth token, and cart

## Retail Catalog Structure

The retail catalog is organized in `app/(retail-catalog)/` using Next.js route groups:
- Route groups `(retail-catalog)` don't affect URL structure but help organize code
- All retail catalog routes are at root level (`/`, `/[productSlug]`, `/cart`, etc.)
- Legacy `/retail/*` routes redirect to new root-level routes for backward compatibility
- Use `~/` alias for imports from `app/` directory when working in route groups
