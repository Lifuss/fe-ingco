# Best Practices

## Performance
- Use Next.js Image component for images
- Implement lazy loading with `LazyImage` component
- Use `next/dynamic` for code splitting when needed
- Cache API responses appropriately
- Remove console.logs in production (configured in `next.config.js`)

## Security
- Never expose API keys in client components
- Use Server Actions for sensitive operations
- Validate all user input with Zod schemas
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Security headers configured in `next.config.js`

## Error Handling
- Use try-catch for async operations
- Handle API errors in Redux thunks with `rejectWithValue`
- Show user-friendly error messages via `react-toastify`
- Use Next.js error boundaries (`error.tsx`)

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Use ARIA labels where appropriate

## Testing Considerations
- Write testable, pure functions
- Keep components decoupled
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
